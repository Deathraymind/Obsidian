| **Location**             | Texas, San Antonio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Programs Offered**     | The "Applied Cyber Analytics" program, which focuses on practical applications of cybersecurity and data analytics, aligns well with national security interests and is thus likely compatible with the [[STOKES]] program's objectives. For more specifics on programs and compatibility, it's advisable to check directly with UTSA's guidance or the STOKES program administration.                 |
| **Cost**                 | Approximately $16,000 a year, based on $552 per credit hour for the 120 credit hours required to complete the bachelor's degree. This figure might vary based on the number of credits, residency status, and specific fees. It's important to calculate the total cost based on the current tuition rate and consider any potential increases over the course of the program.                         |
| **Housing Options**      | Since the program is available online, housing options are flexible. This allows students to live off-campus or in a location that best fits their personal and financial needs, especially for those residing outside of Texas or preferring remote study.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Online Availability**  | UTSA offers online programs, providing flexibility for students who prefer or need to study remotely, which is particularly relevant for those balancing commitments or residing outside of Texas.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **STOKES Compatibility** | The "Applied Cyber Analytics" program's focus areas suggest a strong alignment with the types of skills and knowledge sought by national security agencies, making it a potentially good fit for students interested in the STOKES program. Direct consultation with UTSA and STOKES program advisors would be essential to confirm this compatibility.                                                |
| **Pros**                 | Competitive tuition rates, online program availability, and alignment with national security interests make UTSA an attractive option for students interested in cybersecurity and data analytics fields.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Cons**                 | Potential students should consider the cost of living in Texas (if relocating) and investigate the specific requirements and commitments associated with the STOKES program, such as post-graduation employment obligations. Additionally, the total cost of the program should be carefully considered, taking into account the number of credit hours required and the current cost per credit hour. |
